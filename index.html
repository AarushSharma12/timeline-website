          <h2>Week 1-3</h2>
          <small>"Have You Seen This Movie?"</small>
          <p>
            We read the story Have You Seen This Movie by Allen Ginsberg. It was
            written as essentially jibberish but after some analysis proved to
            be an interesting critique on environmentalism. We also read Writing
            Down the Bones by Natalie Goldberg. The excerpts offer a unique
            approach to writing that emphasizes spontaneity, self-expression,
            and finding one's voice.

          <small>Hope</small>
          <p>
            We watched Greta Thunberg's "Our House is on Fire" speech, delivered
            at the 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos which emphasized the
            urgent need for decisive action to address the climate crisis,
            likening the state of the planet to a house on fire. We also read
            pieces by Rebecca Solnit that explored various successful
            environmental movements and initiatives, highlighting the power of
            collective action and the potential for positive change.

          <small>Blame, Responsibility, and Guilt</small>
          <p>
            In our first big project, we were tasked to choose an item and make
            a visualization of its environmental impact. We made drafts,
            presented them in small groups, and recieved feedback. We also
            watched an episode from "The Breakdown" which is a series focused on
            exploring key issues related to the climate crisis.

          <small>Survival, Scarcity, and Accumulation</small>
          <p>
            In analyzing scenes from Love Death and Robots, we not only
            discussed the environmental implications but also the film making
            techniques. We discussed diegesis, mise en sc√®ne, shot angles, shot
            levels, and other camerawork technqiues.

          <p>
            We read "Climate Changed" by Philippe Squarzoni which is notable for
            its accessible approach to a complex topic, using the graphic novel
            format to visually represent and simplify scientific concepts. It's
            a blend of personal memoir, investigative journalism, and scientific
            reportage, offering a unique and compelling perspective on one of
            the most critical issues of our time. We also did a Shot Sequence
            analysis of a scene from Three Robots using last weeks skills.

          <small>The Role of Corporations</small>
          <p>
            This week we read Charlie Jane Anders' "The Day it All Ended" and
            Paulo Bacigalupi's "The Calorie Man". "The Day It All Ended" (2014)
            by Charlie Jane Anders is a short science fiction story that
            explores themes of consumerism, environmental degradation, and the
            unexpected consequences of technological advancement. "The Calorie
            Man" is a short story set in a future where biotechnology and
            genetic engineering have led to major environmental and societal
            changes.

          <small>Food, Thanksgiving, and Indigenous Peoples</small>
          <p>
            We watched Bong Joon Ho's Snowpiercer to prepare for class this
            week. The film is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a failed
            climate-change experiment has killed off all life on the planet
            except for the inhabitants of the Snowpiercer, a train that travels
            around the globe powered by a perpetual-motion engine. The train is
            divided into strict class segments, with the wealthy living in
            luxury at the front and the poor, oppressed masses crammed into the
            tail. This week we also celebrated Thanksgiving and Native American
            Heritage Day.
